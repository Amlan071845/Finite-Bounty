            Sustainable Development Goal 13 (SDG 13 or Global Goal 13) is to limit and adapt to climate change. It is
            one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The
            official mission statement of this goal is to "Take urgent action to combat climate change and its
            impacts". SDG 13 and SDG 7 on clean energy are closely related and complementary.
<br>
            SDG 13 has five targets which are to be achieved by 2030. They cover a wide range of issues surrounding
            climate action. The first three targets are outcome targets: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to
            climate-related disasters; integrate climate change measures into policies and planning; build knowledge and
            capacity to meet climate change. The remaining two targets are means of implementation targets: 
            <br>To implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and to promote mechanisms to raise
            capacity for planning and management. Along with each target, there are indicators that provide a method to
            review the overall progress of each target. The UNFCCC is the primary international, intergovernmental forum
            for negotiating the global response to climate change.
<br>
            Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming "well under 2 °C". However, with
            pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the
            century.[

            As of 2020, many countries are now implementing their national climate change adaptation plans.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>
            SDG 13 has five targets. The targets include to strengthening resilience and adaptive capacity to
            climate-related disasters (Target 13.1), integrate climate change measures into policies and planning
            (Target 13.2), build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change (Target 13.3), implement the UN Framework
            Convention on Climate Change (Target 13.a), and promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and
            management (Target 13.b).

            Each target includes one or more indicators that help to measure and monitor the progress. Some of the
            indicators are number of deaths, missing people and directly affected people attributed to disasters per
            100,000 population (13.1.1) or total greenhouse emissions generated by year (13.2.2.) 
        </p>

        <h1>Targets, indicators and progress</h1>
        <p></p>
        <div class="target-title">
            <h3>Target 13.1: Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related disasters</h3>
            <p>The full text of Target 13.1 is: "Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards
                and natural disasters in all countries".

                This target has 3 indicators. <br>

                Indicator 13.1.1: "Number of deaths, missing people and directly affected people attributed to disasters
                per 100,000 population" <br>
                Indicator 13.1.2: "Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction
                strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030" <br>
                Indicator 13.1.3: "Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk
                reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies" <br>
                Indicator 13.1.2 serves as a bridge between the Sustainable Development Goals and the Sendai Framework
                for Disaster Risk Reduction. <br>

                In April 2020, the number of countries and territories that adopted national disaster risk reduction
                strategies increased to 118 compared to 48 from the first year of the Sendai Framework.</p>
            <h3>Target 13.2: Integrate climate change measures into policy and planning</h3>
            <p>The full text of Target 13.2 is: "Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies
                and planning".

                This target has two indicators:
<br>
                Indicator 13.2.1: "Number of countries with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies,
                national adaptation plans, strategies as reported in adaptation communications and national
                communications". <br>
                Indicator 13.2.2: "Total greenhouse gas emissions per year"
                In order to stay under 1.5 °C of global warming, carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions from G20 countries need
                to decline by about 45% by 2030 and attain net zero in 2050. To be able to meet the 1.5 °C or even 2
                °C, which is the maximum set by the Paris Agreement, greenhouse gas emissions must start to fall by 7.6%
                per year starting on 2020. However, there is a large gap between these overall temperature targets
                and the nationally determined contributions set by individual countries. Between 2000 and 2018,
                greenhouse gas emissions of transition economies and developed countries have declined by 6.5%. In
                contrast, developing countries saw their emissions go up by 43% between 2000 and 2013.

                As of 2015, 170 countries are a part of at least one multilateral environmental agreement. With each
                year having an increase in the amount of countries signing onto environmental agreements.</p>
            <h3>Target 13.3: Build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change</h3>
            <p>The full text of Target 13.3 is: "Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional
                capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning".

                This target has two indicators:
<br>
                Indicator 13.3.1: "The extent to which <br>(i) global citizenship education and <br>(ii) education for
                sustainable development are mainstreamed in <br>(a) national education policies; <br>(b) curricula; <br>(c) teacher
                education; and <br>(d) student assessment" <br>
                Indicator 13.3.2: "Number of countries that have communicated the strengthening of institutional,
                systemic and individual capacity-building to implement adaptation, mitigation and technology transfer,
                and development actions" <br>
                The indicator 13.3.1 measures the extent to which countries mainstream Global Citizenship Education
                (GCED) and Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) in their education systems and educational
                policies.
<br>
                The indicator 13.3.2 identifies countries who have and have not adopted and implemented disaster risk
                management strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. The goal by 2030 is
                to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all
                countries.
<br>
                To explain the concept of "Education for Sustainable Development and Global Citizenship seeks to equip
                learners with the knowledge of how their choices impact others and their immediate environment.
<br>
                There is currently no data available for this indicator as of September 2020.</p>
            <h3>Target 13.a: Implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</h3>
            <p>The full text of Target 13.a is: "Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the
                United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion
                annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of
                meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green
                Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible."
<br>
                This target only has one indicator: Indicator 13.a is the "Amounts provided and mobilized in United
                States dollars per year in relation to the continued existing collective mobilization goal of the $100
                billion commitment through to 2025".
<br>
                Previously, the indicator was worded as "Mobilized amount of United States dollars per year between 2020
                and 2025 accountable towards the $100 billion commitment".
<br>
                This indicator measures the current pledged commitments from countries to the Green Climate Fund (GCF),
                the amounts provided and mobilized in United States dollars (USD) per year in relation to the continued
                existing collective mobilization goal of the US$100 billion commitment to 2025.
<br>
                A report by the UN stated in 2020 that the financial flows for global climate finance as well as for
                renewable energy are "relatively small in relation to the scale of annual investment needed for a
                low-carbon, climate-resilient transition".</p>
            <h3>Target 13.b: Promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management</h3>
            <p>The full text of Target 13.b is: "Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate
                change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States,
                including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities acknowledging that the United
                Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is the primary international, intergovernmental forum for
                negotiating the global response to climate change."
<br>
                This target has one indicator: Indicator 13.b.1 is the "Number of least developed countries and small
                island developing states with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies, national
                adaptation plans, strategies as reported in adaptation communications and national communications".
<br>
                A previous version of this indicator was: "Indicator 13.b.1: Number of least developed countries and
                small island developing states that are receiving specialized support, and amount of support, including
                finance, technology and capacity building, for mechanisms for raising capacities for effective climate
                change-related planning and management, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized
                communities." This indicator's previous focus on women, youth and local and marginalized communities
                is not included anymore in the latest version of the indicator.

                Annual UN reports are monitoring how many countries are implementing national adaptation plans.

        <h1>Monitoring</h1>
        <p>High-level progress reports for all the SDGs are published in the form of reports by the United Nations
            Secretary General. Updates and progress can also be found on the SDG website that is managed by the
            United Nations and at Our World in Data.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sdgs13">
        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <h3>Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a reduction in economic activity. This resulted in a 6% drop
            in greenhouse gas emissions from what was initially projected for 2020, however these improvements were only
            temporary. Greenhouse gas emissions rebounded later in the pandemic as many countries began lifting
            restrictions, with the direct impact of pandemic policies having a negligible long-term impact on climate
            change. A rebound in transport pollution has occurred since restrictions of government lockdown policies
            have been lifted. Transport pollution accounts for roughly 21% of global carbon emissions due to it
            being still 95% dependent on oil.
<br>
            Post pandemic, there is a rush for governments globally to stimulate local economies by putting money
            towards fossil fuel production and in turn economic stimulation. Funding for economic policies will
            likely divert the emergency funds usually afforded to climate funding like The Green Climate Fund and other
            sustainable policies, unless an emphasis is put on green deals in the redirection of monetary
            funds.</p>
        <h3>Russian invasion of Ukraine</h3>
        <p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting trade sanctions had a further adverse effect on SDG 13, as
            some countries responded to the crisis by increasing domestic oil production.</p>

            <p>Indicator 13.1.2 is the “number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030” in the UN SDG framework.

                <br>  This indicator identifies countries who have and have not adopted and implemented disaster risk management strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
                
                <br>   The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is an international agreement that aims to strengthen disaster preparedness in order to reduce risk and losses from disasters. Although the indicator definition is framed in terms of the number of countries adopting national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework, the United Nations tracks this measure in terms of country levels of implementation.
                
                <br> The interactive visualization here shows levels of country implementation, on a scale from 0 to 1 (where the higher score, the more policies have been implemented). It’s based on an average score from 10 sub-indicators that collectively reflect progress towards implementation of the Sendai Framework.

            <p>Indicator 13.2.2 is the “total greenhouse gas emissions per year” in the UN SDG framework.

                <br>  The ultimate aim of the United Nations Climate Change Convention is to achieve the stabilization of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.
                
                <br>  GHG emissions are measure in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents because each greenhouse gas has a different warming effects: one tonne of methane does not have the same impact on warming as one tonne of CO2. Carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) attempt to convert the warming impact of the range of greenhouse gases into a single metric.
                
                <br>  Target: By 2030 “integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning.”</p>

        <h1>Build knowledge and capacity to meet climate change</h1>
        <h3>Education on climate change</h3>
        <p>Indicator 13.3.1 is the “extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment” in the UN SDG framework.

            <br>  Responses are submitted by national governments – often the Ministry of Education – after consulting across other government ministries, with national human rights institutes, the education sector and civil society organizations.
            
            <br>  National governments submit notes on policies and programmes that facilitate global citizenship eduation across these groups. They are also asked to provide evidence of these interventions.
            
            <br>  The major limitation of this measure is that it is self-reported by national governments.
            
            <br> Target: By 2030 “improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning.”</p>

        <h1>Implement the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change</h1>
        <h3>Green Climate Fund mobilization of $100 billion</h3>
        <p>Indicator 13.a.1 is the “amounts provided and mobilized in United States dollars per year in relation to the continued existing collective mobilization goal of the $100 billion commitment through to 2025” in the UN SDG framework.

            <br>  This indicator measures the current pledged commitments from countries to the Green Climate Fund (GCF) as annual United States dollar contributions pledged. Also shown is the collective global total.
            
            <br>  Target: “Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100 billion annually by 2020 from all sources.”1
            
            <br>  Unlike most SDG targets which have a set target year of 2030, this indicator requires a mobilization of $100 billion per year from 2020 onwards.</p>

        <h1>Promote mechanisms to raise capacity for planning and management</h1>
        <h3>Support for planning and management in least-developed countries</h3>
        <p>Indicator 13.b.1 is the “number of least developed countries and small island developing States with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies, national adaptation plans and adaptation communications, as reported to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change” in the UN SDG framework.

          <br>  Data for this indicator is shown in the interactive visualization.
            
          <br>  Target: By 2030 “Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities.”</p>
