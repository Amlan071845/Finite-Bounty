        <h2>Resource scarcity:</h2>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRuUE36SvY7ZfQHoNueFPGJ9VFqK-wYJfHvAA&usqp=CAU" alt="">
        <p>Many of Earth's resources, such as fossil fuels, minerals, and
            freshwater, are becoming increasingly scarce due to overconsumption and
            unsustainable practices. This scarcity poses significant challenges for future
            generations and requires careful management to ensure their availability.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="keyfinding">
        <h2>Environmental impact:</h2>

        <p>The extraction and utilization of resources often have
            adverse environmental impacts, such as deforestation, habitat destruction,
            pollution, and climate change. Managing resources sustainably involves
            mitigating these impacts through responsible practices and adopting cleaner
            technologies.</p>
