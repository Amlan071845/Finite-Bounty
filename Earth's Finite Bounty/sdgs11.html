        <p>Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG 11 or Global Goal 11), titled "sustainable cities and
            communities", is one of 17 Sustainable Development Goals established by the United Nations General Assembly
            in 2015. The official mission of SDG 11 is to "Make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable". The
            17 SDGs take into account that action in one area will affect outcomes in other areas as well, and that
            development must balance social, economic and environmental sustainability.
            <br>
            SDG 11 has 10 targets to be achieved, and this is being measured with 15 indicators. The seven
            outcome targets include safe and affordable housing, affordable and sustainable transport systems, inclusive
            and sustainable urbanization, protection of the world's cultural and natural heritage, reduction of the
            adverse effects of natural disasters, reduction of the environmental impacts of cities and to
            provide access to safe and inclusive green and public spaces. The three means of implementation targets
            include
            strong national and regional development planning, implementing policies for inclusion, resource
            efficiency, and disaster risk reduction in supporting the least developed countries in sustainable and
            resilient
            building.
            <br>
            3.9 billion people—half of the world’s population—currently live in cities globally. It is projected
            that 5
            billion people will live in cities by 2030. Cities across the world occupy just 3 percent of the
            Earth's
            land, yet account for 60–80 percent of energy consumption and 75 percent of carbon emissions. There
            are
            serious challenges for the viability and safety of cities to meet increased future demands.

        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>SDG 11 addresses slums, human settlement management and planning, climate change mitigation and adaptation,
            and urban economies. Prior to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, Millennium Development Goal 7, target 4,
            called for efforts to achieve a "significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers"
            by 2020.
            <br>
            There has been a rapid growth of mega-cities, especially in the developing world: "In 1990, there were ten
            mega-cities with 10 million inhabitants or more, and in 2014, there were 28 mega-cities, home to a total of
            453 million people". With regards to slums, data shows that "828 million people live in slums today and
            most them are found in Eastern and South-Eastern Asia".
            <br>
            SDG 11 represents "a shift in international development cooperation from a focus on poverty as a rural
            phenomenon to recognizing that cities, especially in the global south, are facing major challenges with
            extreme poverty, environmental degradation and risks due to climate change and natural disasters".
        </p>

    <section class="sdgs11">
        <h1>Targets, indicators and progress</h1>

        <p>The UN has defined 10 targets and 15 indicators for SDG 11. Targets specify the goals, and indicators
            represent the metrics by which the world aims to track whether these targets are achieved. Six of them are
            to be achieved by the year 2030 and one by the year 2020 and three have no target years. Each of the targets
            also has one or two indicators which will be used to measure progress.</p>

        <h3>Target 11.1: Safe and affordable housing</h3>
        <p>The full title of Target 11.1 is "By 2030, ensure access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing
            and basic services and upgrade slums". This target has one Indicator: Indicator 11.1.1 is the
            "Proportion of the urban population living in
            slum households". People who live in slums have no access to improved water, access to improved
            sanitation, sufficient
            living area, and durable housing. There are currently (in 2022) about 1 billion people living in urban
            slums.</p>

        <h3>Target 11.2: Affordable and sustainable transport systems</h3>

        <p>The full text of Target 11.2 is "By 2030, provide access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable
            transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special
            attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and
            older persons". This target has one Indicator: Indicator 11.2.1 is the "Proportion of population that has
            convenient
            access to public transport, by sex, age and Persons With Disabilities". Improving transport systems
            to refine the use of accessibility is key because due to physical or mental disabilities, impaired sight
            or hearing, carrying heavy bags or traveling with small children, as this causes an average of 25% of
            the population to experience a degree of reduced mobility. A sustainable transportation system considers
            different socioeconomic groups' travel concerns to achieve
            the validity of accessibility metrics. Transportation and transportation planning should be coordinated
            with land use planning. Employment and residential areas are relatively concentrated, and urban and
            suburban settings should be planned and reconstructed in concert.</p>
        <h3>Target 11.3: Inclusive and sustainable urbanization</h3>

        <p>The full-text Target 11.3 is "By 2030, enhance inclusive and sustainable urbanization and capacity for
            participatory, integrated and sustainable human settlement planning and management in all countries".

            The target has two indicators:
            <br>
            Indicator 11.3.1: "Ratio of land consumption rate to the population growth rate"<br>
            Indicator 11.3.2: "Proportion of cities with a direct participation structure of civil society in urban
            planning and management that operate regularly and democratically"<br>
            Indicator 11.3.2 may be challenging to calculate. There is currently no data available for this
            indicator.
        </p>
        <h3>Target 11.4: "Protect the world's cultural and natural heritage"</h3>


        <p>The full text of Target 11.4 is "Strengthen efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and
            natural heritage."

            It has one indicator: Indicator 11.4.1 is the "Total per capita expenditure on the preservation,
            protection and conservation of all cultural and natural heritage, by the source of funding (public,
            private), type of heritage (cultural, natural) and level of government (national, regional, and
            local/municipal)".
            <br>
            This indicator is difficult to calculate. There are currently no data available for this
            indicator.
            Due to civil wars, more than half of the In Danger WHSs are located in war zones in Afghanistan, Congo,
            Iraq, Libya, Mali, Palestine, Syria, and Yemen. The modern era sees never-ending civil wars in several
            developing countries, acts of vandalism at cultural sites committed by terrorists and warlords, threats
            to destroy Iranian cultural heritage sites by former US President Donald Trump, a change of identity of
            a WHS (Hagia Sophia) by the Turkish government, deforestation, rapid climate change, out-of-control
            urbanization, and tourism mismanagement by governments which leads to overtourism and hyper-exploitation
            of tourism resources. Because these problems exist, this target has become more prominent than ever.
        </p>
        <h3>Target 11.5: "Reduce the adverse effects of natural disasters"</h3>


        <p>The full text of Target 11.5 is "By 2030, significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of
            people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic
            product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and
            people in vulnerable situations".

            Indicators are:
            <br>
            Indicator 11.5.1: "Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to
            disasters per 100,000 population. Indicators measured here report mortality rates internally displaced
            persons, missing persons and total numbers affected by natural disasters"<br>
            Indicator 11.5.2: "Direct economic loss in relation to global GDP, damage to critical infrastructure and
            the number of disruptions to basic services, attributed to disasters."
        </p>
        <h3>Target 11.6: "Reduce the environmental impacts of cities"</h3>

        <p>The full text of Target 11.6 is "By 2030, reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities,
            including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management."

            The target has two indicators:
            <br>
            Indicator 11.6.1: Proportion of municipal solid waste collected and managed in controlled facilities out
            of total municipal waste generated, by cities <br>
            Indicator 11.6.2: "Annual mean levels of fine particulate matter (e.g. PM2.5 and PM10) in cities
            (population weighted)"
        </p>
        <h3>Target 11.7: "Provide access to safe and inclusive green and public spaces"</h3>

        <p>The full text of Target 11.7 is: "By 2030, provide universal access to safe, inclusive and accessible,
            green and public spaces, in particular for women and children, older persons and Persons With
            Disabilities"<br>

            The two indicators include:

            The Indicator 11.7.1: "Average share of the built-up area of cities that is open space for public use
            for all, by sex, age and persons with disabilities"<br>
            The Indicator 11.7.2: "Proportion of person victim of physical or sexual harassment, by sex, age,
            disability status and place of occurrence, in the previous 12 months"</p>
        <h3>Target 11.a: "Strong national and regional development planning"</h3>

        <p>The full text of Target 11.a is "Support positive economic, social and environmental links between urban,
            peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national and regional development planning".

            It has one indicator: <br>
            Indicator 11.a.1 is the "Number of countries that have national urban policies or
            regional development plans that <br>(a) respond to population dynamics; <br>(b) ensure balanced territorial
            development, and <br>(c) increase local fiscal space."
            <br>
            This indicator is "one of the key metrics to benchmark and monitor urbanization". However, there is
            currently no data available for this indicator.

            The New Urban Agenda was adopted by world leaders in 2016 and provides a series of standards for
            sustainable urban development.
        </p>
        <h3>Target 11.b: "Implement policies for inclusion, resource efficiency and disaster risk reduction"</h3>
        <p>The full text of Target 11.b is "By 2020, substantially increase the number of cities and human
            settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource
            efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and
            implement, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster risk reduction 2015–2030, holistic disaster
            risk management at all levels."
            Unlike most SDGs which have the target year of 2030, this indicator is set to be achieved by 2020.

            The two indicators include:
            <br>
            Indicator 11.b.1: "Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction
            strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030"<br>
            Indicator 11.b.2: "Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk
            reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies"<br>
            A number of challenges in implementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction have been
            identified, including inconsistent, unstructured, disorganized data collection and reporting, the lack
            of incentives for proactive report disaster loss, and the lack of governmental mandate on disaster loss
            reporting.
        </p>
        <h3>Target 11.c: Support least developed countries in sustainable and resilient building</h3>

        <p>The full text of Target 11.c is formulated as "Support least developed countries, including through
            financial and technical assistance, in building sustainable and resilient buildings using local
            materials".
            <br>
            This target has one Indicator:
            Indicator 11.c.1 is the "Proportion of financial support to the least
            developed countries that is allocated to the construction and retrofitting of sustainable, resilient and
            resource-efficient buildings using local materials".

            It was suggested in 2020 to delete Indicator 11.c.1.
        </p>
        <h3>Custodian agencies</h3>
        <p>The custodian agencies are responsible for data gathering and reporting on the indicators:
            For the indicators of Targets 11.1, 11.2 and 11.3 and also for Indicator 11.a.1 and Indicator 11.c.1:
            United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT)
            For Indicator 11.4.1: United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization-Institute for
            Statistics (UNESCO-UIS)
            For the two indicators under Target 11.5 and for Indicator 11.b.2: United Nations International Strategy

        <h1>Monitoring</h1>
        <p>High-level progress reports are prepared by United Nations Secretary General annually, evaluating the
            progress towards all the Sustainable Development Goals. The most recent report was published in 2021.
            The previous report was from April 2020.

            In 2018, High-level Political Forum (HLPF) took stock of progress on the Sustainable Development Goals and
            discussed progress, successes, challenges and lessons learned on the road to a fairer, more peaceful and
            prosperous world and a healthy planet by 2030. SDG 11 was one of the six SDGs discussed in depth.

            The progress on the SDG 11 has been stalled by the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the direct and indirect impacts
            of the pandemic, this Goal is increasingly less likely to be achieved in a timely manner.

            All the UN member states are committed to following up their progress towards implementing the 2030 Agenda
            and its goals and targets. Almost all the UN member states have presented their national progress towards
            the SDGs through Voluntary National Review (VNR). Despite the importance of cities within the
            sustainable development framework, only a few initiatives have emerged to assess progress towards the SDGs
            on a city scale.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="sdgs11">
        <h1>Challenges</h1>
        <h3>Impacts of COVID-19 pandemic</h3>
        <p>Cities in many countries were epicentres of COVID-19. Approximately 60% of COVID-19 cases have been found
            in urban areas, shedding light onto the function of cities in generating and accelerating the pandemic.
            Both congestion and increased mobility in cities have been named as some of the major contributors to the
            spread of epidemics through aerosols, droplets and fomities.

            The COVID-19 pandemic has illuminated the deeply rooted inequalities in the cities, which is reflected in
            disproportionate pandemic-related impacts on migrants, the homeless, and the residents of urban slums and
            informal settlements. The success of SDG 11 post-pandemic requires concerted action on the part of
            Governments at all levels, civil society and development partners.

            During the crisis, cities have emerged as drivers of economic recovery, centres of innovation and catalysts
            for social and economic transformation. Smart city technologies and solutions have contributed to
            resilience in cities by facilitating gathering and exchange of information in real time, decreasing risk,
            and enhancing planning, absorption and adaptation abilities.</p>

        <h1>Examples at country level</h1>
        <h3>Canada</h3>
        <p>The Canadian federal government has allotted $10 billion CAD over 3 years to the Canadian Infrastructure Bank
            to begin investing in green projects across the country focusing on areas such as transit, renewable energy,
            and building retrofits. The federal government is meeting its SDG 11.2 and SDG 11a targets by investing
            $1.5 billion in public transit and having 5000 busses in the next 5 years within a wider uplifting growth
            strategy to refocus the inequalities faced by different urban and rural regions in Canada. The federal
            government has also seen a slight rise in the proportion of the urban population that lives in inadequate
            housing, rising from 12.5% in 2011 to 12.7% in 2016, moving away from lowering the goal of adequate
            housing.</p>

    <section class="sdgs11">
        <h1>Safe and affordable housing</h1>
        <h3>Urban population living in slums</h3>
        <p>Indicator 11.1.1 is the “proportion of urban population living in slums, informal settlements or inadequate housing” in the UN SDG framework.

            <br>A slum household is defined as a group of individuals living under the same roof lacking one or more of the following conditions: access to improved water, access to improved sanitation, sufficient living area, durability of housing, and security of tenure.
            
           <br> Informal settlements are often synonymous with slums, and refer to settings lacking security of tenure, formal basic services and city infrastructure, and compliance with current planning and building regulations.

          <br>  This indicator identifies countries who have and have not adopted and implemented disaster risk management strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction.
            
           <br> The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is an international agreement that aims to strengthen disaster preparedness in order to reduce risk and losses from disasters. Although the indicator definition is framed in terms of the number of countries adopting national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework, the United Nations tracks this measure in terms of country levels of implementation.
            
          <br>  The interactive visualization here shows levels of country implementation, on a scale from 0 to 1 (where the higher score, the more policies have been implemented).
