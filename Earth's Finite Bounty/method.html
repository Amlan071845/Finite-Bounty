    <section class="method">
        <h1>Material collection and analysis of Data</h1>
        <h2>Data</h2>
        <p>• Global land area: 13.4 billion hectares <br>
            • Agricultural land: 4.9 billion hectares (37%) <br>
            • Forest land: 4.0 billion hectares (30%) <br>
            • Other land (e.g., urban areas, deserts, and ice): 4.5 billion hectares (33%)</p>
        <h2>Trends</h2>
        <p>• The global population is projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, putting increasing pressure on land
            resources. <br>
            • Urbanization is also increasing, with more than half of the world's population expected to live in cities
            by 2050. <br>
            • Climate change is also impacting land resources, with more frequent and severe droughts, floods, and other
            extreme weather events.</p>
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>• Land degradation <br>
            • Land fragmentation <br>
            • Land conflict</p>
        <h2>Opportunities</h2>
        <p>• Sustainable land management practices <br>
            • Agroforestry <br>
            • Conservation agriculture <br>
            • Integrated pest management (IPM)</p>

        <h1>Literature Review on Land Resource Management</h1>
        <h2>Historical and current significance of land resources</h2>
        <p>Land resources have been essential for human survival and well-being since the
            dawn of time. Agriculture, the foundation of human civilization, is dependent on land
            resources. Land is also used for urban development, infrastructure development,
            and the provision of other essential services.</p>
        <h2>Environmental, social, and economic impacts of land resource management</h2>
        <p>Land resource management has a significant impact on the environment, society,
            and the economy. Unsustainable land management practices, such as deforestation,
            overgrazing, and excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, can lead to a range of
            environmental problems, including soil erosion, water pollution, and biodiversity loss.
            These environmental problems can have a negative impact on human health and
            well-being, as well as on the productivity of land resources.
            Land resource management also has a significant impact on society.
            Land resource management also has a significant impact on the economy.
            Agriculture and other land-based industries contribute significantly to the global
            economy.</p>
        <h2>Existing research, policies, and best practices in land management</h2>
        <p>There is a large body of research on land resource management. This research has
            identified a number of best practices, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture,
            and integrated pest management. However, there are also a number of challenges
            to implementing these best practices, such as institutional barriers and lack of
            financial resources. <br>
            There are also a number of government policies in place to promote sustainable land
            resource management. However, the effectiveness of these policies varies widely. In
            many cases, there is a need for better coordination and enforcement of policies.</p>
        <h2>Gaps in the current literature</h2>
        <p>While there is a large body of research on land resource management, there are a
            number of gaps in the current literature. For example, there is a need for more
            research on the following: <br>
            • The impacts of climate change on land resources and land management
            practices. <br>
            • The social and economic impacts of land degradation and displacement. <br>
            • The effectiveness of different land management policies and practices in different contexts. <br>
            • The role of indigenous knowledge and practices in sustainable land resource management.</p>

    <section class="method">
        <h1>Stakeholder engagement</h1>
        <p>Stakeholders include individuals and groups that have an interest in or are affected by land resources. This
            can include landowners, farmers, indigenous peoples, local communities, businesses, government agencies, and
            environmental organizations.</p>
            <h2>Benefits of stakeholder engagement</h2>
            <p>• Improved decision-making <br>
                • Reduced conflict <br>
                • Increased buy-in and support</p>
            <h2>Approaches to stakeholder engagement</h2>
            <p>There are a variety of approaches to stakeholder engagement. The best approach will depend on the specific context of the land management initiative and the stakeholders involved. Some common approaches include:
            <br>• Consultations
            <br>• Negotiations
            <br>• Participatory decision-making SDG</p>
